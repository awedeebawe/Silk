KSDataDownloader
======

KSDataDownloader is a thin layer on top of NSURLConnection. While it may not be as sophisticated as a full featured HTTP library such as AFNetworking, it does a good job of abstracting the most commonly used functions when talking to an app backend server. KSDataDownloader is very lightweight and does not bloat your project with unneccesary stuff.


## Installation
Use CocoaPods to add KSDataDownloader to your project. Just add the following line to your Podfile.
```
pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 1.0.0'
```
